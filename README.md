# Smart Temperature Monitoring
The aim of the project is to realize an IoT system that monitors a close environment's temperature and automatically handles a window to regulate the room's temperature. It also offers a dashboard and a control panel to activate manual mode, which allows operators to manually control the window, overriding the default system behavior.
